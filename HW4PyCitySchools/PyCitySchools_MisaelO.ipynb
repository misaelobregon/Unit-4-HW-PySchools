    "* Overall findings in the data yield a pattern where charter schools out-performed public district schools across math, reading, and overall passing rate (determined by combined math and reading passing rates). For results see sections \"Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)\", \"Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)\", and \"Scores by School Type.\"   \n",
    "\n",
    "* A second finding shows that schools with higher budgets did not yield better test results when compared to those of lower budgets. For results see section \"Scores by School Size.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "* When comparing school size and overall passing rates, results show that smaller and medium sized schools out-performed large sized schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A comparision in math and reading scores across schools shows that across grades, 9th through 12th, the mean scores appear to be similar; meaning not a large leap in average scores from grade to grade. Grades 9th and 12th are stacked together to provide comparison in average scores between grades. For results see sections \"Math Scores by Grade\" and \"Reading Scores by Grade.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* At this point we can not determine why smaller size and lower budgeted schools are outperforming their counterparts. It is tempting to say that charter schools may serve students better by specualating size and perhaps education system practices, however additional anayalyses are needed. Perhaps mean comparison testing in performance outcomes between school types (i.e., district and charter schools), controlling for size of school, spending, and perhaps include grade as well. Perhaps the use of a logistic regression may yield additional interesting results. \n",
